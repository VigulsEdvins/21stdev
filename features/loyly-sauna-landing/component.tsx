// Löyly Sauna Landing: a complete landing page for a public sauna and cold
// plunge, printed in two inks. A cool white grid sheet, one Swiss grotesk and a
// halftone screen in safety orange and black: orange is heat, black is cold.
//
// The screen carries the whole page. In the hero it is the heat coming off the
// stove; press "Throw water on the stones" (or click anywhere in the heat) and
// a wave of löyly, the steam that rises when water hits hot stones, rolls up
// through the dots while the felt-heat readout climbs and settles back. The
// same screen prints the three rooms by temperature, the 90-minute ritual, the
// spots left in each session, the featured membership and the footer, where the
// heat cools to black.
//
// It is a working page, not a poster: a bookable weekly timetable with day
// tabs, spots left, full sessions and a waitlist; memberships with a monthly
// or yearly price; member quotes; questions; a visit section with hours and a
// newsletter form. Every word, session, room, plan and the ink are props.
//
// Everything is drawn here. The halftone is canvas 2D with a fixed dot budget
// that coarsens itself on slow (software) renderers, the patterns are CSS, the
// type is the system Helvetica stack, and nothing loads at runtime.
